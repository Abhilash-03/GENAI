# GENAI MODEL (GEMO) Project with Gemini Integration
- This project demonstrates a powerful application of Generative AI (GENAI) using the Gemini API. It allows users to enter prompts, and through the integration with Gemini, generates creative and informative results based on the prompt.

 ### Features:
 - `Prompt-Driven GENAI`: Users can submit prompts for various tasks like creative writing, code generation, or summarization.
 - `Gemini Integration`: Leverages the capabilities of the Gemini large language model from Google AI for text generation.
 - `User-Friendly Interface`: Built with Node.js, Express.js on the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend for a seamless user experience.
